<h2 id="CD">Course Description</h2>
<p>Studying Digital Media with Community Engagement & Social Change involves more than just understanding technologies. It revolves around a story.  Documenting perspectives toward bestowing a strategy to foster a voice toward a socially accepted change opens up more profound audiences' acceptance. Learning how the world functions socially within an open digital society is essential. 
This course takes students beyond the technological aspects by bringing their vision to their own choices. Students will enable the freedom to develop their perspectives within social change and study. These fundamentals and alternative models and theories will provide students with the context to critically adapt their methods to help build their story that creates a societal impact</p>
<p> This course is an introduction to the privacy issues in the digital domain. Throughout, we examine how various technologies have influenced the nature of human privacy. This course provides an interdisciplinary approach to conceptualize privacy through the development of technology. It also analyzes the legal, ethical, and social characteristics of violation and protection privacy.</p>
<p>This course is intended to improve students&rsquo; skills in areas including: reading comprehension, information synthesis, critical thinking, and analytical writing.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Activity Submissions</h3>
<p>Submit all assignments through Webcourse's Assignment Page</p>
<h2>Assignment Policies &amp; Procedures</h2>
<h3>Discussions</h3>
<p>Each unit will have a discussion post prompt. Generally, discussions are based on reading from the text, documentaries, and other online sources.</p>
<p>The discussions will be due at the end of each unit and may be completed at any time during the unit.</p>
<p>Discussion participation will be graded out of 7 points, variable according to quality. You can <strong>earn a bonus points by:</strong>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Making a substantial reply to another student's post. You will receive a half point (.5) added to your grade for that discussion. That's .5 total--not .5 for each reply you make. <strong>Note that making a reply is optional</strong>: you receive credit if you make a quality reply, but you are not penalized if you don't reply.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to receive a grade of 7.5 out of 7 for each discussion.</p>
<p>For more information about discussion grading, see the <a title="Discussion Post Guide and Rubric" href="/courses/1362486/pages/discussion-post-guide-and-rubric">Discussion Post Guide and Rubric</a>.</p>
<h3>Quizzes</h3>
<p>To evaluate knowledge, there will be quizzes throughout the semester.  All quizzes will be completed through Webcourses.</p>
<p>We have created the quiz questions with the understanding that you will have your course materials available to you. It&rsquo;s fine if you use them. <strong>But you may not: 1. Collaborate with others, in any fashion, to complete the quizzes or 2. Use any resources outside of our class (such as the internet).</strong></p>
<p>Quizzes will cover material since the previous quiz; they are not cumulative. Questions may be drawn from lectures, textbook chapters, and/or other assigned readings/videos/documentaries.</p>
<p>We will aim to have quizzes posted by Wednesday during the week they are assigned.</p>
<h3>Exam</h3>
<p>There is one exam in this course, a cumulative Final Exam.&nbsp; The exam contains 100 questions and is worth 100 points.&nbsp; The Final exam counts for 10% of the student's final grade.&nbsp; The exam is composed of questions from the several Unit Quizzes throughout the course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have created the Final Exam questions with the understanding that you will have your course materials available to you. It&rsquo;s fine if you use them. <strong>But you may not: 1. Collaborate with others, in any fashion, to complete the exam or 2. Use any resources outside of our class (such as the internet).</strong></p>
<h3>Make-up Work and Late Assignments</h3>
<p>Per university policy, you are allowed to submit make-up work (or an equivalent, alternate assignment) for authorized university-sponsored activities, religious observances, or legal obligations (such as jury duty). If this participation conflicts with your course assignments, I will offer a&nbsp;reasonable opportunity for you to complete missed assignments and/or exams. The make-up assignment and grading scale will be equivalent to the missed assignment and its grading scale. In the case of an authorized university activity, it is your responsibility to show me a signed copy of the Program Verification Form for which you will be absent, prior to the class in which the absence occurs. In any of these cases, please contact me ahead of time to notify me of upcoming needs.</p>

<p>Students sometimes dislike the +/- system. I use it because I think there's a real difference between, say, an 89 and an 80 (or really a 79.5 rounded up). It doesn't seem fair that both should earn Bs.  <a href="http://catalog.ucf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">catalog</a> for regulations and procedures regarding grading such as Incomplete grades, grade changes, and grade forgiveness.</p>

            <p>Students should familiarize themselves with <a href="http://osc.sdes.ucf.edu/process/roc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UCF&rsquo;s Rules of Conduct</a>. According to Section 1, "Academic Misconduct," students are prohibited from engaging in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Unauthorized assistance</em>: Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information or study aids in any academic exercise unless specifically authorized by the instructor of record. The unauthorized possession of examination or course-related material also constitutes cheating.</li>
                <li><em>Communication to another through written, visual, electronic, or oral means</em>: The presentation of material which has not been studied or learned, but rather was obtained through someone else&rsquo;s efforts and used as part of an examination, course assignment, or project.</li>
                <li><em>Commercial Use of Academic Material</em>: Selling of course material to another person, student, and/or uploading course material to a third-party vendor without authorization or without the express written permission of the university and the instructor. Course materials include but are not limited to class notes, Instructor&rsquo;s PowerPoints, course syllabi, tests, quizzes, labs, instruction sheets, homework, study guides, handouts, etc.</li>
                <li><em>Falsifying or misrepresenting</em> the student&rsquo;s own academic work.</li>
                <li><em>Plagiarism</em>: Using or appropriating another&rsquo;s work without any indication of the source, thereby attempting to convey the impression that such work is the student&rsquo;s own.</li>
                <li><em>Multiple Submissions</em>: Submitting the same academic work for credit more than once without the express written permission of the instructor.</li>
                <li><em>Helping another violate</em> academic behavior standards.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For more information about Academic Integrity, students may consult <a href="https://academicintegrity.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Center for Academic Integrity</a>.</p>

            <h4>Responses to Academic Dishonesty, Plagiarism, or Cheating</h4>
            <p>Students should also familiarize themselves with the procedures for academic misconduct in UCF&rsquo;s student handbook, <a href="https://goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Golden Rule</a>. UCF faculty members have a responsibility for students&rsquo; education and the value of a UCF degree, and so seek to prevent unethical behavior and when necessary respond to academic misconduct. Penalties can include a failing grade in an assignment or in the course, suspension or expulsion from the university, and/or a "Z Designation" on a student&rsquo;s official transcript indicating academic dishonesty, where the final grade for this course will be preceded by the letter Z. For more information about the Z Designation, see <a href="http://goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu/zgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu/zgrade</a>.</p>

            <p> Students who believe they may have a COVID-19 diagnosis should contact Health Services so proper contact tracing procedures can take place. Students should not come to campus if they are ill, are experiencing any symptoms of COVID- 19, have tested positive for COVID, or if anyone living in their residence has tested positive or is sick with COVID-19 symptoms. CDC guidance for COVID-19 symptoms is located here: (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). Students should contact their instructor(s) as soon as possible if they miss class for any illness reason to discuss reasonable adjustments that might need to be made.

            <h4><em>Fully online course sections (W, V)&nbsp;</em></h4>
            <p>Though most emergency situations are primarily relevant to courses that meet in person, such incidents can also impact online students, either when they are on or near campus to participate in other courses or activities or when their course work is affected by off-campus emergencies. The following policies apply to courses in online modalities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To stay informed about emergency situations, students can sign up to receive UCF text alerts by going to <a class="offsite external" href="https://my.ucf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://my.ucf.edu</a>&nbsp;and logging in. Click on &ldquo;Student Self Service&rdquo; located on the left side of the screen in the toolbar, scroll down to the blue &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo; heading on the Student Center screen, click on &ldquo;UCF Alert&rdquo;, fill out the information, including e-mail address, cell phone number, and cell phone provider, click &ldquo;Apply&rdquo; to save the changes, and then click &ldquo;OK.&rdquo;</li>
                <li>Students with special needs related to emergency situations should speak with their instructors outside of class.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4><em>Sections with face-to-face components (M, RA, RV)&nbsp;</em></h4>
            <p>Emergencies on campus are rare, but if one should arise during class, everyone needs to work together. Students should be aware of their surroundings and familiar with some basic safety and security concepts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In case of an emergency, dial 911 for assistance.</li>
                <li>Every UCF classroom contains an emergency procedure guide posted on a wall near the door. Students should make a note of the guide&rsquo;s physical location and review the online version at <a class="offsite external" href="http://emergency.ucf.edu/emergency_guide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://emergency.ucf.edu/emergency_guide.html</a>.</li>
                <li>Students should know the evacuation routes from each of their classrooms and have a plan for finding safety in case of an emergency.</li>
                <li>If there is a medical emergency during class, students may need to access a first-aid kit or AED (Automated External Defibrillator). To learn where those are located, see <a class="offsite external" href="https://ehs.ucf.edu/automated-external-defibrillator-aed-locations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ehs.ucf.edu/automated-external-defibrillator-aed-locations</a>.</li>
                <li>To stay informed about emergency situations, students can sign up to receive UCF text alerts by going to <a class="offsite external" href="https://my.ucf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://my.ucf.edu</a>&nbsp;and logging in. Click on &ldquo;Student Self Service&rdquo; located on the left side of the screen in the toolbar, scroll down to the blue &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo; heading on the Student Center screen, click on &ldquo;UCF Alert&rdquo;, fill out the information, including e-mail address, cell phone number, and cell phone provider, click &ldquo;Apply&rdquo; to save the changes, and then click &ldquo;OK.&rdquo;</li>
                <li>Students with special needs related to emergency situations should speak with their instructors outside of class.</li>
